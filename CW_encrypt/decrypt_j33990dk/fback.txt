This does not mean the program did not execute however, it may or may not have produced some files or none:

    file = open(sys.argv[1], "r")
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: './test_files_encrypt'

No files were created within the results folder. (This does not mean files were not created elsewhere)
