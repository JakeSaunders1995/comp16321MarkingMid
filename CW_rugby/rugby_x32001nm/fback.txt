This does not mean the program did not execute however, it may or may not have produced some files or none: 

 Traceback (most recent call last):

    with open(file1, "r") as fin:
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: './test_files_rugby'

No files were created within the results folder. (This does not mean files were not created elsewhere)
